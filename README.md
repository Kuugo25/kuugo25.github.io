## Featured Projects

### Predicting Truth and Lies from Audio Data üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kuugo25/deception-detection-audio-ml)
- Built an ML pipeline to classify spoken stories as true or false using extracted acoustic features.
- Compared models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees) using GridSearchCV and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Used 5-fold cross-validation and soft voting to improve accuracy and generalization.

### üñº CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Deep CNNs (PyTorch) üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kuugo25/cifar10-deep-cnn)
- Designed and implemented a deep convolutional neural network from scratch, featuring **six intermediate adaptive blocks** with learned feature weighting.
- Used **channel-wise attention mechanisms** to combine convolutional outputs dynamically, enhancing model expressivity.
- Applied strong regularization (dropout, batch normalization), data augmentation, cosine learning rate scheduling, and SGD with momentum.
- Achieved a **test accuracy of 92.42%** on CIFAR-10, surpassing standard architectures through architectural tuning and training optimization.

### SUPREME Video Game Search Engine (Information Retrieval System) üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Gitbyt3/SUPREME-Video-Game-Search-Engine)
- Developed a modular search engine using **BM25**, **SBERT + FAISS**, and **LambdaMART** for Learning-to-Rank.
- Implemented full **query processing** (normalization, parsing, expansion, intent detection) and **hybrid candidate retrieval**.
- Designed a **web-based interface** with a Python backend, returning Top-K ranked games based on query intent and user behavior.
- Conducted manual labeling for 100 sample queries and evaluated with **mAP, NDCG@10, MRR, E-measure** (mAP = 0.7633, NDCG@10 = 0.8995).
- Addressed runtime, tuning, and semantic challenges with efficient scoring and semantic embedding techniques.
