## Featured Projects

### Predicting Truth and Lies from Audio Data
- Built an ML pipeline to classify spoken stories as true or false using extracted acoustic features.
- Compared models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees) using GridSearchCV and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Used 5-fold cross-validation and soft voting to improve accuracy and generalization.

### CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch
- Designed a custom CNN architecture with multi-block layers and learned convolutional weights.
- Achieved **92% test accuracy** using batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling.
- Built the network entirely from scratch using PyTorch.
