## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🎙 [Predicting Truth and Lies from Audio Data](https://github.com/Kuugo25/deception-detection-audio-ml)
- Built a machine learning pipeline to classify spoken stories as true or false using acoustic features extracted from audio files.
- Trained and compared models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees) using GridSearchCV and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Applied 5-fold cross-validation and used soft voting to improve classification accuracy.

### 🧠 [CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Deep CNNs (PyTorch)](https://github.com/Kuugo25/cifar10-deep-cnn)
- Designed and implemented a custom CNN with six intermediate adaptive blocks and learned feature weighting via attention mechanisms.
- Applied regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization), data augmentation, cosine annealing, and SGD with momentum.
- Achieved **92.42% test accuracy** on CIFAR-10 through architectural tuning and optimization.

### 🎮 [SUPREME Video Game Search Engine (IR System)](https://github.com/Gitbyt3/SUPREME-Video-Game-Search-Engine)
- Developed a modular IR system using **BM25**, **SBERT + FAISS**, and **LambdaMART** for learning-to-rank.
- Implemented complete **query processing**, hybrid retrieval, intent detection, and user-based ranking signal boosts.
- Delivered strong evaluation results: mAP = 0.7633, NDCG@10 = 0.8995, MRR = 0.8222 across 100+ labeled queries.
